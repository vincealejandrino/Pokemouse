# Pokemouse
A java program which involves creating a highly simplified version of an RPG game inspired by the original Pok√©mon games. The main objective is to collect all creatures from a given list. This is accomplished through two primary mechanics: area exploration and evolution.

The game begins by prompting the user to select one Evolutionary Level 1 (EL1) starter creature. This chosen creature is automatically added to the user's inventory and set as their active creature.

After the starter creature is selected, the user is presented with a menu screen containing several options. These options include viewing the inventory, exploring an area, evolving a creature, and exiting the game. Through these options, players can manage their collection of creatures, discover new ones, and evolve their active creature to progress in the game.
